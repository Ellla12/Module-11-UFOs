# Module 11: UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this module is to help Dana, a data journalist, research UFO sighting information from around the world.
To help Dana with her research we will be using the following:
- JavaScript to create an interactive dashboard and to help her filter the UFO information.

For the Module 11 Challenge, we further help Dana by adding a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by:
- Allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time
- Add table filters for city, state, country, and shape

## Results
To use the webpage, the user can open up the UFO sightings page and look at the raw data-set as a whole. They can scroll down and go through all the listed information.

To get a more in-depth analysis, they can add in filter details to narrow down their search of UFO information. For example, if I wanted to search for UFO sighting information from only California, all I would need to do is add in the CA filter and click on the filter button.

## Summary
Drawbacks:
- The largest draw back of this webpage is that the data-set is small. I believe more data should be added for a better analysis.
Additional Recommendations:
- Current, filters can be improve by adding in data validations. For example, right now if I wanted to filter dates, I can put in any characters. I suggest changing it to only include date type information.
- More on the data-set, we can make it more dynamic by having its data be updated through a UFO sightings database.
